# SudokuSolver
Personal project, planning on weekly progress

This SudokuSolver works cyclically by filling up every non given cell with numbers 1-9 and then erases illegal numbers.
After erasing illegal numbers, cells will eventually only have 1 legal number left over which are then treated
as a given number and then the cycle begins again.
